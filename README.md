# basic-ppo
Extremely simplistic but readable TF2.0 implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm. Written from scratch and solely based on the description in "Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms" (Schulman et al, 2017).

Note that this learner's performance is poor because it does not make use of target networks.

Requirements:
Tensorflow 2.0
OpenAI Gym
